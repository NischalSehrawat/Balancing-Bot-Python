# Balancing-Robot-RaspberryPi
This is my project for balancing an inverted pendulum using a Raspberry Pi. The main aim of the project is to learn about the following topics
- Gain an insight into the physics of the problem and understand the equation of motions. I have used [this](https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/meceng/61/2/article-p331.xml) paper and followed [this](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mobile-robot) course. 
- Learn about classic and modern control theories. Source [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi7l8mMjYVE&list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR20Mz-VpzgfQs5zrYi085m)
- Learn about concepts like controllability, observability, LQR technique to derive controller gain. Source [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi7l8mMjYVE&list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR20Mz-VpzgfQs5zrYi085m)
- Learn and code my own Kalman Filter for Sensor Fusion. Source [here](https://home.wlu.edu/~levys/kalman_tutorial/)
- Check how do Kalman and Complimentary filters compare with each other
- Learn how to implement the learned concepts on actual hardware and understand the problems encountered.
- Learn how to make RaspberryPi communicate with arduino over Serial port.
- Learn how to use rotory encoders to get RPM of a motor and smoothen the data.
