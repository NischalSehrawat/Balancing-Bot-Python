# Balancing-Bot-Python
This is a project for balancing an inverted pendulum using a Raspberry Pi. Later on I shall try to add more functionalities to it. Since the Pi already has a lot of very nice libraries, it makes the code much more simple and shorter and the focus can be shifted on main problem instead of dealing with hardware problems. The only disadvantage is that the Pi doesn't have analogue read functionality for reading potentiometer data. This is done using Arduino board and the data is transferred to the Pi using Serial communication.
