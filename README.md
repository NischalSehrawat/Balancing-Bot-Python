# Balancing-Bot-Python
This is my project for balancing an inverted pendulum using a Raspberry Pi. The main aim of the project is to learn about the following topics
- Gain an insight into the physics of the problem and understand the equation of motions
- Learn about classic and modern control theories. Good links were found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi7l8mMjYVE&list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR20Mz-VpzgfQs5zrYi085m)
- Learn about concepts like controllability, observability, LQR technique to derive controller gain
- Learn and code my own Kalman Filter for Sensor Fusion
- Check how do Kalman and Complimentary filters compare with each other
