# Balancing-Robot-RaspberryPi
This is my project for balancing an inverted pendulum using a Raspberry Pi. In my [earlier ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TRXWSr9_dE&list=PLveRMPt4kAsA41ivMscrzFSWWx54CI52J&t=0s&index=2) approach I was successful in making the robot balance but in order to move it like a **Segway**, it needs more thorough analysis. Therefore I decided to go into greater details and study it more thoroughly. The main aim of the project is to learn about the following topics
- Gain an insight into the physics of the problem and understand the equation of motions. I have used [this paper](https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/meceng/61/2/article-p331.xml) and followed [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mobile-robot). 
- Learn about classic and modern control theories. [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi7l8mMjYVE&list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR20Mz-VpzgfQs5zrYi085m)
- Learn about concepts like controllability, observability, LQR technique to derive controller gain. [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi7l8mMjYVE&list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR20Mz-VpzgfQs5zrYi085m)
- Learn and code my own Kalman Filter for Sensor Fusion. I struggled a lot to find sources that explained it from the very basics and finally found some good reads. Sources [1](https://home.wlu.edu/~levys/kalman_tutorial/), [2](http://blog.tkjelectronics.dk/2012/09/a-practical-approach-to-kalman-filter-and-how-to-implement-it/) and [3](https://github.com/balzer82/Kalman/blob/master/Kalman-Filter-CV.ipynb?create=1).
- Check how do Kalman and Complimentary filters compare with each other.
- Learn how to implement the concepts learnt on physical hardware and understand the problems encountered.
- Learn how to make RaspberryPi communicate with arduino over Serial port. [Source](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=396450)
- Learn how to use rotory encoders to get RPM of a motor and smoothen the data. Info about using encoders can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLBYHbLO8W0). For smoothing RPM data I have used exponential averaging.
- Info about dc motor control (using 2 wires instead of 3 for speed control) can be found [here](https://www.bluetin.io/python/gpio-pwm-raspberry-pi-h-bridge-dc-motor-control/). Info about using MPU6050 library on a RaspberryPi can be found [here](https://libraries.io/pypi/mpu6050-raspberrypi). Hoever for robot control it is easier to use Robot builtin class on gpiozero library on RasPi. Info about using various builtin classes on RaspPi can be found [here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing/16).
